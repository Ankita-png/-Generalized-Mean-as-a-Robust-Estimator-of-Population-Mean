# Generalized-Mean-as-a-Robust-Estimator-of-Population-Mean
It aims in finding an easier method of Robust estimation for population mean. Along with comparing our proposed method with a minimum power divergence method.\
Our proposed method is obtained to be the Generalized Mean method, which is found to be a much more efficient and stable estimator of population mean. Here in this project it will be shown how well the Generalized Mean will estimate the population mean of a contaminated population from all other well known estimators.\
Finally, our final aim will be comparing our proposed method with a minimum divergence method which was proposed in "Robust and eï¬ƒcient estimation by minimising a density power divergence" by  A. Basu, I. Harris, L. Hjort, M. Jones.
